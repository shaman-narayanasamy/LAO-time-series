# LAO-time-series repository
## Issues and questions

Please direct **issues or inquiries** about the workflow to the original [Gitlab repository](https://git-r3lab.uni.lu/shaman.narayanasamy/LAO-time-series). 

This repository is created to perform time series analyses for the LAO samples from the one year time series. 

The folder contains a Snakemake file that constructs the workflow, an execution script for the Snakemake file and a launcher script to launch the commands over the OAR scheduler.

Additional sources are included in the src folder and the config file is used to adapt to the cluster environment and to somewhat customize the analysis.
